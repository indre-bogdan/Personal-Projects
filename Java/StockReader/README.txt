	This small project has been created after finishing a course on multithreading. It requires an Internet connection to run.
	From a technical point of view, the purpose of the application is to better understand the responsiveness of the GUI when data must be constantly gathered in the back-end (this can be seen in the animation and by pressing the names of the stocks and then in comparison the price/value of them), also, to use javaFx for the first time.
	From an economical point of view, it is still undergoing. For now, it only displays the current value of the BET index and the current value of its constituents, but further improvements can be added, most importantly: more data (current and historical), a way to store this data in a constant manner for offline review, graphs created by this data for technical analysis, a way to gather news about the stocks for fundamental analysis and many more. Overall, the sky is the limit.
